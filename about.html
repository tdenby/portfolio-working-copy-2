            <p>I am an aspiring user experience designer/researcher currently finishing my Bachelor of Arts in cognitive science at the University of Michigan. In fall of 2021, I will 
                be starting my master's degree in Human Factors and Ergonomics at San Jose State University. <br><br> </p>
            <p>Much of my work has been done in marketing, having served as 
                both Director of Marketing for the professional technology fraternity Kappa Theta Pi, as well as having volunteered on the marketing committee for the 
                housing non-profit The Inter-Cooperative Council of Ann Arbor. <br><br> </p>
            <p>I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the comp.social lab, a social computing lab within the University of Michigan School of Information. There I participated in
                studies in social media based around conduct on the internet. One of these projects included studying Russian Troll inteference in the 2016 election via Twitter; the other
                one was on social signals on Twitter and whether computer-generated signals of someone's toxicity made users feel more comfortable reaching out to strangers. <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>Besides technology, my other interests include theater, cinema, and music. I am an avid alternative music concert goer, and I dabble in guitar occasionally. 
                I have been known to do a play every now and then, or participate in a local indie film. <br><br>
